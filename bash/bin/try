# try(1) -- Attempt a certain number of times to perform a task, stopping after
# the first success, and only print collected stderr if all the attempts
# failed. Designed for running from systems like cron(8) where blips and
# short-term failures can be ignored.
#
# -h gives help, -v gives you diagnostics on stdout, -i sets an optional number
# of seconds between each attempt, -n sets the number of attempts (defaults to
# 3).
